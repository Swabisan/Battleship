# Battleship
a side project of mine, using what I've learned so far in my classes to create a java based game of the board game "Battleship" against a computer opponent.
* Note:  I've been programming for about a month now, so I expect this to be dirty.
* Currently trying to fix a bug regarding the win condition of the game & optimize code
